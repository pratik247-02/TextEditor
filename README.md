Created with Next.js and Mantine UI

This is a simple app that creates colored Discord messages using the ANSI color codes available on the latest Discord desktop versions.

To use this, write your text, select parts of it and assign colors to them, then copy it using the button below, and send in a Discord message.

Source Code
This app runs entirely in your browser and the source code is freely available on GitHub. Shout out to kkrypt0nn for this guide.
